About general function
======================

The checkit-tool validates a TIFF-file against a set of rules (see below). The
set of rules works as a whitelist. This means that if a tag in the TIFF file is
not explicitely checked by rules (independently if successfully or not) the tag
is not allowed. In cases where a rule is executed only if a predicate is set,
the tag is only allowed if the predicate succeeded.

to configure the grammar you could use the PEG-extension for gvim from https://github.com/gf3/peg.vim

Users
=====
to define your own config-file to check TIFFs, please use this simplified
syntax:

* each line is either a tagline, a comment or empty
* a comment starts with # first
* a tagline is built via "TAG ; REQUIREMENTS ; VALUES", where
* a TAG is a increasing number similar to TIFF-Tag numbers (see TIFF
definition)
* REQUIREMENTS could be "mandatory", "optional" or "depends(TAGREFERENCE.VALUE)"
** TAGREFERENCE points to a tag number which must be exists, 
** VALUE could be 'any' or a decimal value or a string enclosed in '"'
* VALUES could be one of these:
** "range(START, END)" where START and END are decimal values
** "logical_or( VALUELIST)" where VALUELIST are comma-separated decimale values
** "any" which means any match
** "only(VALUE) where VALUE is a decimal value or a string enclosed in ""
* each tagline or comment must be closed with a new line

If multiple rules defined per tag, they will be combined alternatively.
