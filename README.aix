Because AIX is something different, here some hints to compile:
1. check if you have gcc, if so then set environment to "CC=gcc"
2. check if your make-command is AIX original, then call "make -f makefile.aix"
3. if your make-command is GNU make, then call just "make"

(Hint: the reason for 2. is, that AIX make has differences usign $< within
makefiles)
